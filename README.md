## Hi there üëã

# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ I'm currently working on predicting LTE network performance using machine learning models, analyzing the impact of terrain features on signal quality and strength.<br>üëØ I'm looking to collaborate on innovative projects in machine learning, particularly in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, or multi-agent reinforcement learning systems.<br>ü§ù I'm looking to expand my knowledge in LLM optimization techniques, focusing on quantization methods, model architecture optimization, inference acceleration, and large-scale processing techniques to enhance the performance and scalability of large language models while maintaining their accuracy and capabilities.üå± I'm currently learning MLOps to streamline the machine learning lifecycle, focusing on automated deployment, CI/CD pipelines, model monitoring, data management, and cloud-based platforms to enhance the efficiency and reliability of ML systems.üí¨ Ask me about machine learning algorithms, C++ programming for robotics, or developing efficient algorithms for healthcare technology applications.<br>‚ö° Fun fact: I once developed a CNN-based system for agricultural waste identification that achieved 85% accuracy and was published in Springer, combining my passion for sustainability with cutting-edge technology!
